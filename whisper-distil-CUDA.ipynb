      "General's case up to the tune of a half a billion dollars and a bond has been\n",

      "settled a civil case against a couple of the Trump attorneys who'd been involved\n",
      "in the fraudulent elector scheme. We now have learned that grand jury subpoenas\n",

      "jury subpoenas have gone out to them and I think possibly a few other people\n",
      "associated with that scheme. So we'll see what comes of that in the coming days\n",
      "and weeks. So we've got a lot. So we ought to get going. Okay. So let's talk\n",
      "about immunity and we'll sort of differentiate the motion that's before Judge\n",
      "Cannon in the Florida case and the motion before Judge Mershon in the New York\n",
      "case. In many ways, there's a lot to say about the Judge Cannon litigation, but\n",
      "that's sort of a story of a slow boat to nowhere, because there just is no sign\n",
      "that that's going to get scheduled before the election. That's why the Judge\n",

      "to delay going to trial? But before we get to sort of the substance, I wanted to\n",
      "give you, Mary, sort of my big picture on immunity. And it sort of relates more\n",
      "to the immunity issue before the Supreme Court. And just as a reminder, I think\n",
      "that's perfect, Andrew, you know, that issue up in the Supreme Court is whether\n",
      "and to what extent does a former president have immunity from criminal\n",
      "prosecutions for actions alleged to have been taken within the outer perimeter\n",
      "of his official acts. So that's the question as it relates to, of course, the\n",
      "January 6th case. The case brought by Jack Smith in the District of Columbia,\n",
      "District Court, where he alleges, Mr. Trump alleges, that pretty much everything\n",
      "he did was within the scope of his official acts and therefore he is immune from\n",
      "criminal prosecution. That's been rejected now by four judges. Right, and that's\n",
      "the Supreme Court's going to weigh in on that. But the way I think about this is\n",
      "sort of two issues to think about in terms of like what's in my head. One is\n",
      "something that you have repeatedly told me and our listeners that because this\n",
      "is about immunity, the normal rule that you don't wait until the case is over\n",
      "goes by the wayside. That's why they're these appeals pre-verdict. The normal\n",
      "rule is that you have a verdict and then you appeal whatever factual and legal\n",
      "issues are, you know, and the defendant, if there's conviction, raises them. But\n",
      "here because the defendant's saying I'm immune, they shouldn't even go forward,\n",
      "the court allows that to be heard. And so that's why these issues can sort of\n",
      "cause delay. That's sort of bucket one. Bucket two is that the issue in the\n",
      "Supreme Court is not whether Judge Chukkin correctly decided what is the date of\n",
      "the trial and did she abuse her discretion and was it enough time or not enough\n",
      "time. What's before the Supreme Court is just this immunity issue. Why is that\n",
      "relevant? Because the way I look at it is if you just are considering that\n",
      "issue, the government has an enormous interest in having that decided quickly\n",
      "because the government has a duty and the public has an interest in having a\n",
      "speedy trial and the public has an interest in having a speedy trial. And the\n",
      "defendant may have an interest in never going to trial. They may have an\n",
      "interest in delaying the trial date, but that's not the issue before the court.\n",
      "The issue is the immunity issue. And a defendant who says they're immune and\n",
      "wants to be vindicated on that has an interest in saying, every single day that\n",
      "this criminal case is pending, I am harmed because it shouldn't be... I\n",
      "shouldn't have to go through it at all, right? I shouldn't have to go through\n",
      "it. I shouldn't be suffering the approbrium of a criminal charge and just to\n",
      "relate it to Donald Trump specifically. And what's unique is he says there's a\n",
      "gag order in the DC case that is interfering with my ability to campaign for the\n",
      "presidency. This is a form of election interference. And so all of that is why\n",
      "his interest is to have this decided quickly. So what I'm really saying is, I,\n",
      "like you agree that defense lawyers make all sorts of arguments, you know, as\n",
      "long as they're in good faith, that's their job. The Supreme Court has sort of\n",
      "weighed in essentially by the sort of lack of days goal. Leisurely schedule.\n",
      "Yes, leisurely languid. Get your thesaurus out. And so this issue of immunity\n",
      "now raised before Judge Cannon and Judge Mershan is one that the only legitimate\n",
      "interest on that issue is for both parties to want it decided quickly. Based on\n",
      "the rationale you just described, that's right. But that is not what we're\n",
      "seeing, right? That is clearly not what they're saying. Exactly. But if you're a\n",
      "judge, like if I'm going before Judge McCord, I would expect Judge McCord to\n",
      "turn to the parties to say, what possible reason is there not to do this\n",
      "expeditiously on this issue? Because for the life of me, I can't think of a\n",
      "legitimate argument on this issue. That's sort of a backdrop as to how I'm\n",
      "thinking about this and that it's not, it shouldn't be a vehicle to do what the\n",
      "Supreme Court unfortunately has done. Well, by scheduling it the way they have,\n",
      "it has put the trial date in issue even though you're absolutely right. This\n",
      "motion, this appeal, none of this is really about the trial date, but the impact\n",
      "of it is until the Supreme Court decides things, there's no trial taking place\n",
      "on the January 6th case. So what's interesting about the way you've laid that\n",
      "down, about the interest that there should be, is to quickly determine, hey, I\n",
      "can't be put to trial at all, let's move that motion quickly. And even though\n",
      "Judge Kianen in the Marilago case has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on some\n",
      "of the motions, she actually has not scheduled the hearing on that motion. The\n",
      "motion filed by Donald Trump's attorneys arguing that the first 32 counts of the\n",
      "indictment, those are the counts that relate to the mishandling of national\n",
      "defense information, those counts should all be dismissed on the grounds of\n",
      "presidential immunity. That is not a motion she's hearing on Thursday. She's\n",
      "hearing motions to dismiss the case on the grounds of the Presidential Records\n",
      "Act and on vagueness grounds. And so we'll talk about those in a minute. To get\n",
      "to the substance of what Mr. Trump's attorneys are doing in both Marilago and\n",
      "now the Alvin Bragg Manhattan case is they're saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, you\n",
      "should just pause everything here and wait for the Supreme Court to issue its\n",
      "decision on presidential immunity from criminal prosecution because that will\n",
      "impact these cases. And the real question there I think that I think you and I\n",
      "both think is rather frivolous is that it really would impact these two cases\n",
      "because these are in very different posture than the January 6th case. And by\n",
      "posture, I don't mean where we are in the schedule. I actually mean in the\n",
      "January 6th case, if the president were to win on his argument that all of his\n",
      "conduct, all of the alleged conduct in the indictment is within the scope of his\n",
      "official acts, then the entire case goes away. He cannot be prosecuted. In\n",
      "Maralago, the argument is that, you know, remember, for this to apply, and right\n",
      "now the question from the Supreme Court is, does it apply at all? Does\n",
      "presidential immunity apply at all, even to things within the scope of official\n",
      "acts? Both Judge Chukkin and the district court and the three judges unanimously\n",
      "on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said no, it doesn't apply. For it to apply,\n",
      "you have to have been doing something within the scope of your official acts,\n",
      "right? And so remember that the Maralago indictment is about retaining\n",
      "classified and national defense information after Mr. Trump was no longer the\n",
      "president, failing to return it when he was asked by the National Archivist and\n",
      "by the Department of Justice to return it. Those are not things that he did in\n",
      "the scope of his official acts as president because he was no longer the\n",
      "president. Yeah, I mean, but it's literally saying I had the right to take the\n",
      "stuff to Marilago. That is not a defense to the illegal retention and the\n",
      "obstruction, etc. So that is very frivolous. It is, of course, before Judge\n",
      "Cannon. And so the second immunity motion is in New York. Oh, before we go to\n",
      "that, can we mention one point? Because you've used the word frivolous. And so\n",
      "if I, listeners may recall that even in the January 6 case, even though\n",
      "everything stops when Mr. Trump took an appeal of the immunity issue, there is\n",
      "an argument, and I think this would be more applicable in the Marilago case,\n",
      "that if the immunity issue is so frivolous that it should not stop the trial. A\n",
      "district court judge can make that decision. And district court judge can say,\n",

      "right? I mean, these are things the jury clearly found against him on. And one\n",
      "of the important things to recall is that in the second trial, the judge did say\n",
      "these questions about whether she was sexually assaulted or whether these\n",
      "statements are falsehoods, or lies, that's already been decided. There was a\n",
      "full and fair opportunity to litigate that in the first trial. It's been decided\n",
      "against you, Mr. Trump. You are collaterally estopped. In other words, you're\n",
      "precluded from getting a second jury to re-decide those questions. So yeah,\n",
      "exactly, no do-overs. And so if E. Jean Carroll would say, darn it all, here he\n",
      "is doing it again. I'm bringing another lawsuit. We would expect, again, that he\n",
      "would be precluded from re-litigating the things that have already been decided.\n",
      "So we'd really be mostly talking about a jury's deciding, did you say these new\n",
      "things? And what's the number, the amount of the damages? Now, I don't know if\n",
      "she'll bring another case or not. I mean, it's not fun going to trial. It's not\n",
      "fun being on the witness stand. And, you know, she already has huge verdicts\n",
      "against Mr. Trump. But gosh, darn it, it's got to be really hard to sit here and\n",
      "listen to him, just do it over and over and over again and clearly these\n",

      "obligation to grow through something called pre-publication review. I actually\n",
