      "motion for a stay, which is somewhat of an emergency type rushed motion, they\n",
      "can put out an order any time they want. They could have put it out on the\n",

      "what's in Mary's head the court in general will talk about stay petitions and\n",
      "cert petitions on Fridays. And so there was a real sense last week that all the\n",
      "papers were getting in in anticipation of that Friday conference. And so I\n",
      "think, Mary, that's what's in the back of your head for this is the first sort\n",
      "of full day after the conference. And there's some urgency. And we'll talk about\n",
      "why I think that. But we've got to get through like our opening remarks before\n",
      "we get to our substantive remarks. You're right. This is like the opening in a\n",
      "case where you're like, let me tell you what you're going to hear at the trial.\n",
      "And then let me tell it to you again. Yeah, exactly. So the second thing is\n",
      "Judge Ngoran, which is the New York civil case that the attorney general\n",
      "brought. He had said he was going to be issuing his decision, and he did. And\n",
      "there is, in total, with interest that he imposed, there is an amount of about\n",
      "$450 million. By the way, that has been sometimes reported as only about 350,\n",
      "and that's because people have not been counting the interest. So it's about 450\n",
      "million. At that end, I never do math in public, but I'm going to do rough math,\n",
      "which is if you add 450 to about 90 in the Echin Carroll case soon, we're\n",
      "talking about real money. We are talking about some real money. Yep, so it's\n",
      "about half a billion dollars. We're going to talk about that decision and sort\n",
      "of what's next. And then of course we had Judge Merchan last week denying\n",
      "Trump's motions to dismiss the case that the New York DA Alvin Bragg had brought\n",
      "the very first criminal case brought against Mr. Trump almost a year ago for a\n",
      "number of false business records relating to hush money payments to Stormy\n",
      "Daniels, which was really an effort to keep her from talking during an election\n",
      "and potentially hampering Mr. Trump's campaign back in 2016. So it really is an\n",
      "election interference case that people like to call a hush money case, but it's\n",
      "really about efforts to, you know, prevent that information from getting out. So\n",
      "that's set to go to trial in late March. And then of course we'll talk a little\n",
      "bit about the hearings last week down in Fulton County, Georgia involving the\n",
      "district attorney Fannie Willis and a special counsel that her office had\n",
      "appointed Nathan Wade and the motions to disqualify Ms. Willis. So so much, so\n",
      "much to cover. Okay, Mary, I'm already tired and I'm just listening to the\n",
      "intro. Okay. And we already have our producer saying, you know, you're almost\n",
      "out of time on the first issue. And we're like, wait a minute. We haven't\n",
      "started the first issue yet. Okay. So this is this basically my producer\n",

      "that's our new word around our house, too, by the way. Okay, snap a doodle, no\n",
      "anecdotes, get to the substance. So, Supreme Court, Mary, go. What do we expect\n",
      "today? And you were going to say, why are you thinking it might be this morning\n",
      "or this week, certainly? Yeah, so you may recall last week all that had happened\n",
      "when we recorded as Mr. Trump had sought this stay and he sought a stay because\n",
      "the DC Circuit had said we're gonna send the mandate back to the trial court to\n",
      "go ahead and put the trial back on schedule unless you go to the court by last\n",
      "Monday, February 12th and seek a stay pending your petition for cert. So of\n",
      "course Mr. Trump filed that on Monday. We talked about it Tuesday. The court,\n",
      "the chief justice, gave the government a week to file its opposition, but Jack\n",
      "Smith of course did not wait a week. He filed his opposition much, much earlier\n",
      "than that. And then immediately, even though they didn't have to file a response\n",
      "that quickly, immediately Mr. Trump came in with his reply. So that entire\n",
      "briefing got compacted down to just a few days. And as you were just previewing,\n",
      "Mr. Trump's attorneys filed their reply brief on Thursday night, knowing that\n",
      "the court would be meeting for conference on Friday. And I think thinking, wow,\n",
      "they don't want the court to rule on this just based on Jack Smith's opposition.\n",
      "They want to get their reply in and make sure that's in front of the court. And\n",
      "because we know the court met on Friday and frankly, I think the court has had\n",
      "ample time to figure out does it want to take this case or not. I think it knows\n",
      "that based, you know, on having already, I mean, I know the court's busy, it has\n",
      "other huge cases, but still, they're not oblivious to what's happening in the\n",
      "world, and I think they probably were well aware of this issue as it percolated\n",
      "up through the district court and the DC circuit, and they've looked at these\n",
      "platingsings and I think they probably all have an opinion about whether they\n",
      "want to take this case or not. So I think some of us thought they might make a\n",
      "decision Friday. I also thought it was possible that one or more justices might\n",
      "be wanting to write something. So if they decide that they're going to just\n",
      "grant the stay, they could also treat that motion for a stay like a petition for\n",
      "cert. In fact, Jack Smith specifically said in his filing, we think you can deny\n",

      "Smith wanted to leapfrog the DC circuit. He says, even though we told you how it\n",
      "important it is, we're not saying it's not important anymore. We're just saying\n",
      "the DC circuit got it right. You just denied cert once before. Now there's even\n",
      "more reason to deny cert because the DC circuit got it right. And importantly,\n",
      "you don't have to agree with everything the DC circuit said in order to deny\n",
      "cert and deny the stay. You can just agree that in a case like this, where the\n",
      "crimes charged are related to an effort to stay in office and overturn the votes\n",
      "of the American people and extend your term in office beyond when it should have\n",
      "ended. This is all you have to decide here. That in a situation like that you\n",
      "don't get immunity from criminal prosecution. One of Trump's points that he sort\n",
      "of harps on, both in his moving papers and in his reply papers, is very much,\n",
      "you know, Jack Smith, this is what you had previously wanted to take how this\n",
      "got to the Supreme Court. What happened? You were saying it's such a big issue.\n",
      "I would make the same point if I were them, but there's such a good answer,\n",
      "which is that was about speed. That was like, you know what, we need to jump\n",
      "this forward because of the need to have a result. And so the natural response\n",
      "is there's a very good court of appeals decision that address this issue. It's a\n",
      "frivolous issue in many ways, certainly as you said in the context of this case.\n",
      "So there's nothing inconsistent about speed. They got it right and the speed is\n",
      "there. And so I think that was sort of an important issue. The other quick thing\n",
      "is that some people have taken to task. Why didn't Jack Smith say, why? Why\n",
      "didn't he give a reason for why this is so important to do quickly? And Trump is\n",
      "saying, what's the big deal? Why take it so quickly? Of course, because he's\n",
      "thinking, I don't want to have the facts in the trial come out before the\n",
      "election, but I didn't see any reason why, I mean, Jack Smith should be faulted\n",
      "for saying that the American public should have its day in court. I mean, that\n",
      "there is this speedy trial act actually requires the public's interest to be one\n",
      "of the considerations. The trial court actually already factored that in and\n",
      "picked a trial date. And essentially Trump and his, especially his reply brief,\n",
      "is basically trying to get the court to reconsider Judge Chukkin's decision\n",
      "about the trial date. I mean, just directly says, what's the big deal? It\n",
      "shouldn't be this fast. She's rushing us to trial. That's not technically at all\n",
      "what's before the court. He's saying this is all political, right? That's\n",
      "essentially what Trump is saying. And the fact is that, you know, everyone knows\n",
      "and appreciates the significance of why it's important to move with alacrity on\n",
      "this. It's true that Jack Smith does not tie it in his papers to the election,\n",
      "but we all live in this world and it's obvious that we're talking about\n",
      "allegations against Mr. Trump that if proven are hugely significant to the\n",
      "future of sort of governance in this country and what's coming up. So I think\n",
      "everyone understands that including the Supreme Court. I think to the point I\n",
      "was developing up to about why it might be taking a few extra days is that,\n",
      "again, the court could decide to go ahead and grant the stay and grant cert\n",
      "right based on the stay petition. They don't have to wait and have a whole\n",
      "briefing. Mr. Trump wants a whole briefing. Give us a chance to go first brief\n",
      "up a petition for rehearing on bonk in the DC circuit so that the full DC\n",
      "circuit can hear. Then after they rule, give us a chance to file a petition. You\n",
      "know, I don't think the Supreme Court's going to go for that, so they could\n",
      "grant the petition. But even if they deny it, it could very well be that one or\n",
      "two might want to write a dissent from the denial, and even that those who\n",
      "concur might want to write some sort of limiting statement, like Justice\n",
      "Kavanaugh did when they denied cert in the Trump v. Thompson case, explaining\n",
      "something like the point I just made if they agree with it, which is that this\n",
      "is not saying, we're not saying by denying the stay that we agree with\n",
      "everything the DC Circuit said. We're not saying that there would never in any\n",
      "circumstance be immunity from criminal prosecution for a former president for\n",
      "things done within the scope of his special acts we don't have to decide any of\n",
      "that here all we're saying that in this case on these facts we're denying the\n",
      "stay. And we'll see. I mean, I'm obviously out speculating. There was a very, I\n",
      "thought, powerful amicus brief, friend of the court brief from our friend, Judge\n",
      "Ludig, and several others from six previous Republican administrations, making\n",
      "that very point, which is Supreme Court, you don't have to agree with\n",
      "everything. But here in a case like this, it's so obvious and important that he\n",

      "to be in the law school class for a moment is this tension is to when a court,\n",

      "other people and entities. And so he had six other causes of action. He found\n",

      "respect to Donald Trump himself, so it's a total of six causes of action. Why is\n",
      "that particularly relevant? Some people might be like, why do you need more than\n",
      "one? It's because those additional causes of action actually required higher\n",
      "showings that you need to reach different elements, such as you needed to\n",
      "actually have intent to defraud, which wasn't required for the first cause of\n",
      "action, and Judge Goren found that. So he found liability with respect to Donald\n",
      "Trump, both Don Jr. and Eric Trump, Alan Weisselberg, Jeff McCanny, who had\n",
      "worked for the Trump organization and various Trump entities. He also found\n",
      "various amounts of disgorgement. As you said, Mary, if you count the\n",
      "disgorgement and the interest came to about $450 million. There were various\n",
      "amounts also with respect to disgorgement of Allen Weisselberg's a million\n",
      "dollars from him for his severance agreement which the judge found to be\n",
      "improper, about $4 million each with respect to Don Jr. and Eric Trump. So\n",
      "various amounts, those are all things that in that part of the judgment, within\n",
      "30 days, if nothing else were to happen, within 30 days, that is enforceable,\n",
      "meaning that the plaintiff, the Attorney General's office, could start to\n",
      "enforce that. They could find assets. They could seize assets. In this case,\n",
      "because there's a monitor overseeing it, they could actually force sales if\n",
      "nothing else were to happen. That's unlikely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I'm\n",
      "so saying. But it's important to know, yes, that's how things work in the\n",
      "ordinary course, right? Right, that's sort of running in the background that\n",
      "something has to happen or in 30 days it's enforceable. There is one aspect\n",
      "though that isn't an injunction that is in effect now. Immediately, right right\n",
      "when the decision came out it enjoined Donald Trump in various ways and one of\n",
      "the things that it said is that he's enjoined from taking out a loan, new loans\n",
      "with respect to banks that are either chartered or registered in New York. And\n",
      "that I shouldn't, and I shouldn't just say banks, it's all financial\n",
      "institutions, which is a term that's slightly broader. That is huge because you\n",
      "know Deutsche Bank is an example. That's like one of the few banks that was\n",
      "willing to do business with Donald Trump. So why am I raising that? Because that\n",
      "injunction is in place now. And in order to have this not go in effect, there\n",
      "are a number of things that Donald Trump could do, but one of the things is he\n",
      "either can put up all the money now while he appeals the decision. He obviously\n",
      "can appeal the decision. That's not an issue, but if he doesn't put up the money\n",
      "or a bond, it is enforceable. Unless you get a court to somehow change that. So\n",
      "he either has to put up the money, and I'll relate this to E. Jean Carroll a\n",
      "moment, that decision, or he has to find a company that puts up essentially\n",
      "what's called, um, something's called like an appeal bond. Yeah. And what that\n",
      "is, is that I find a company that says, you know what, if I pay you this company\n",
      "X million dollars, that company will put up the money for me for a fee and with\n",
      "collateral. But Donald Trump has probably because of his loans and a personal\n",
      "guarantee. I've worked in this area. There are all sorts of restrictions when\n",
      "you take out a loan. You have put liens on property. You have covenants about\n",
      "what you can and cannot post. If you've got liens on property, you can't use it\n",
      "for a secondary purpose. So if you're a bank, you know, right, you're going to\n",
      "be like, wait a second, that collateral is for me. That's not for somebody else.\n",
      "So I'm not willing to relinquish my lien. Also, sometimes when you get out a\n",
      "loan, a bank will say, I want collateral, but I also want to guarantee that\n",
      "you're going to keep a certain amount of cash on hand. So there are all sorts of\n",
      "restrictions when you take out a loan, like in a business context like Donald\n",
      "Trump, and he gave a personal guarantee. So this relates to anything he can do.\n",
      "So it's not clear to me that he will either be able to put up the money or be\n",
      "able to find enough collateral and a company that's willing to put up this bond.\n",
      "And so the other choice is finding a third party who is willing to do this for\n",
      "him. And there's nothing that prevents a third party, you know, friends, family,\n",
      "foreign friends, Elon Musk friends. Exactly. So the issue there is, if it is a\n",
      "third party, somebody who is running for president and then could be president\n",
      "could be enormously beholden to that person. I mean, to the tune of, we could\n",
      "literally be saying. Hundreds of millions of dollars, yes. And we could be\n",
      "saying, hey, Mary, I can give you half a billion reasons why Donald Trump is\n",
      "going to be favorable to my company, my country, right? Exactly. Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "So if you're MBS or Saudi Arabia or some Russian oligarch or Elon Musk, you\n",
      "might be thinking, hey, yep, that's right. Time for me to swoop in and be the\n",
      "Savior. So that I think really tells people really clearly sort of like the\n",
      "financial aspect of what he's got to do to appeal. But I want to come back to\n",
      "the injunctive relief. So injunctive relief is a permanent court order, right,\n",
      "preventing somebody from doing something. And you already talked here about what\n",
      "Trump's being prevented from doing, or sometimes it's telling them they have to\n",
      "do something, right? So it's equitable. It's not usually about money. It's about\n",
      "like stopping behavior or requiring certain behavior. And to do that, a court\n",
      "has to find that you're likely to continue to do this bad thing. And it wasn't\n",
      "just this thing you did in the past and it's never going to happen again but\n",
      "you're likely to continue to do it and that's why they have to issue an\n",
      "injunction and I think some of the most impactful language in judging Goran's\n",
      "opinion is when he is talking about why he's issuing injunctive relief. And he\n",
      "talks about a number of things, including the Trump organization in Donald\n",
      "Trump's history, has been so replete that there's no reason to think they're\n",
      "going to stop inflating assets now. But another is when he has a couple of\n",
      "paragraphs on refusal to admit air. And I think this was just really so\n",
      "powerful. He talks about how Trump and the other defendants, their complete lack\n",
      "of contrition and remorse borders on pathological. They're only accused of\n",
      "inflating asset values to make more money. The documents prove this over and\n",
      "over again. This is a venial sin, not a mortal sin. Defendants did not commit\n",
      "murder or arson. They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not\n",
      "burning made of, yet defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their\n",
      "ways. Instead, they adopt a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil posture\n",
      "that the evidence belies. And that's so interesting to me because he's actually\n",
      "saying, this is not the crime of the century. It's very significant to the\n",
      "financial markets and to New York. And so I'm entering a big judgment because\n",
      "you did reap the benefits of your fraud and your falsity. But like, come on,\n",
      "guys, why did you have to come in here and essentially lie? Because you did it.\n",
      "And this is why I have to enjoin you, because you still won't admit you did\n",
      "anything wrong, so I have every reason to believe you're going to keep doing it.\n",
      "Yeah, so I couldn't agree more that that was sort of striking to me because he\n",
      "does bar Donald Trump for three years from essentially running a company in New\n",
      "York. Why? Because of exactly what you said, which is that he couldn't be\n",
      "trusted to do that. In addition, what he can run a company, it's required to\n",
      "have not one but two oversight personnel, so essentially a compliance monitor\n",
      "and an independent monitor to babysit him. And if you step back even further to\n",
      "what does this mean, you have a judge, after a full hearing, after actually\n",
      "hearing from Donald Trump, hearing from all of his witnesses, direct and\n",
      "cross-examination, putting in all of the evidence saying, you cannot be trusted\n",
      "to run a company in New York for three years and even after that you cannot be\n",
      "trusted to do it on your own without oversight. This is the man who is asking\n",
      "the public to run our country for four years. That's right. To elect him to run\n",
      "our country, yep. So the contrast between a judge saying the rule of law, where\n",
      "facts and law matter saying you cannot be trusted to run a company in New York\n",
      "wants to yet be the leader of the free world run a country for four years. I\n",
      "mean, an enormous discrepancy between what is happening in the courts and what\n",
      "is happening in the Court of Public Opinion. Yeah, absolutely. So, should we\n",
      "take another break? Yes, and then we'll quickly talk about the criminal case in\n",

      "and filings that we've spoken a lot about. But folks may remember that the trial\n",
      "date that had been set in that case was March 25th. Then there had been some\n",
      "discussions when Judge Tanya Chukkin in D.C., who's presiding over the January\n",

      "other case is not going forward in early March. That would be less than two\n",
      "weeks from now. So Judge Mershon had a hearing. He did a couple of things.\n",
      "Importantly, he denied all of Mr. Trump's motions to dismiss the case. You know,\n",
      "we've been talking about motions to dismiss in the January 6 related case a lot,\n",
      "but there were motions to dismiss. In fact, some were similar type motions,\n",
      "including a motion to dismiss on the grounds of selective prosecution. The judge\n",
      "denied all of those motions and said we're going to trial on March 25th over the\n",

      "Mary, just to make it clear, that date was not something that was not already on\n",

      "knew the DC trial wasn't going to happen, which they did, this was a distinct\n",
      "possibility. But anyway, there was one small aspect of the motions that Judge\n",
      "Mershan ruled in favor of Donald Trump. There are various theories for why this\n",
      "is a felony versus a misdemeanor, and he rejected one of four theories, meaning\n",
      "there's still three theories that the state can go to the jury on. But one of\n",
      "them related to Karen McDougall, he said, was not sufficiently presented to the\n",
      "grand jury. It shouldn't make a big difference. And we can get into the details\n",

      "the 2016 presidential election and then falsified 34 business records to cover\n",
      "up the payoff. In this court's view, those are serious allegations. And that is\n",
      "not word for word, but that is the exact same sentiment that Judge Hellerstein,\n",
      "a federal judge, found as well when he rejected Donald Trump's effort to take\n",
      "the case federal. So you have two judges, a federal and state court judge,\n",

      "week. Yeah, I think there's like a legal piece and there's a factual piece.\n",
      "That's right. So legally, I can really understand why people are like, this is\n",
      "like apples and oranges. Who cares who she's sleeping with? What does this have\n",
      "to do with the guilt or innocence of the defendants? It just seems like a\n",
      "sideshow and there is a ton to support that. One of the givens here though is\n",
      "that the judge has said what he is concerned about is the issue of financial\n",
      "benefit. In other words, it's not about an affair directly. And it's not just\n",
      "him saying that's what I care about. That's what the law is, right? You only\n",
      "have a conflict of interest if you've got an interest like a financial interest\n",
      "or a personal interest or something like that. Yeah, of course the financial\n",
      "interest isn't really in whether there's conviction or not. It's like the\n",
      "allegation is so, seemed so strange, which is that because Fannie Willis was\n",
      "having a personal relationship with a special counsel, somebody hired from\n",
      "outside the office to come in, so there's a contract. Whether she had a\n",
      "relationship before that or after that, it's somewhat irrelevant. It's just a\n",
      "question of were they going Dutch? Yeah, when they were out spending money was\n",
      "he using money he got from her office to enrich her and for her benefit. And of\n",
      "course he he's not destitute beforehand, and so there's no sort of like, neither\n",
      "is she. Right, so this isn't like he's using the money that he got from the\n",
      "contract as the only thing he's ever earned in his life. And the idea that this\n",
      "is being done for some, like if you had to look at intent, there's no way in\n",
      "God's Green Earth that she's doing it for that reason or he's thinking that. I\n",
      "mean, it just seems so preposterous and also the amounts are so trivial when you\n",
      "think about Harlan Crow and like it's impossible not to think about Harlan Crow\n",
      "and like vast amounts of money going to Supreme Court justices who still sit on\n",
      "cases so that the apples and oranges of all of this and the tawdryness of it is\n",
      "something that's really hard to fathom in terms of what they're put through. So\n",
      "I come at this is that this is a side show and I don't really understand the law\n",
      "here as to like how it allows this this increasing so frivolous and so far is\n",
      "uncontroversed evidence that they roughly split things. I do think that areas\n",
      "that I would keep an open eye for sort of whether defense can actually prove it\n",
      "is whether there is more evidence about when their relationship started because\n",
      "yeah there is a conflict of witnesses. You have Fannie Willis and Mr. Wade\n",
      "saying it started after Mr. Wade was hired. You have a witness who they've said\n",
      "is disgruntled, which doesn't, by the way, mean that she's telling the truth or\n",
      "lying, but she may have a motive, but you can also be disgruntled and tell the\n",
      "truth. That's right. But she says it happened before. And the issue is whether\n",
      "there's more to that. There is apparently text messages by Mr. Ways, friend and\n",
      "lawyer, but those according to the defense they think may undermine the issue of\n",
      "when the relationship started. Again, a bit of a side show because maybe it\n",
      "would now show that somebody was less than candid in court, but it's really not\n",
      "all that relevant to the issue of the financial component, which is what the\n",
      "judge said he's really concerned about. There was one question put Tiffany\n",
      "Willis that I'm going to be interested to see whether the defense has more\n",
      "evidence, which is she said I basically did the true up of making things even\n",
      "with cash. And the issue isn't so much that she had cash on hand, though her\n",
      "father said that she had kept cash. There's no contrary evidence. There's no\n",
      "reason to disbelieve that. But she said I didn't use Venmo or a cash app because\n",
      "I wasn't sure whether he had it. And so I'm going to be keeping an eye out of it\n",
      "for whether because the defense seems to have access to his divorce filings,\n",
      "again, very today, that they do. But whether they can sort of show that he used\n",
      "a cash app. Big picture, though, I don't think this is going anywhere unless\n",
      "facts really change. This seems like a really, I won't say frivolous, but it\n",
      "should be denied. Yeah, there could end up, I mean, the part you were just\n",
      "getting at about when this relationship started again the relevance here is if\n",
      "they had a relationship personal intimate romantic relationship before she hired\n",
      "him the theory would be that means you purposefully hired him so that you could\n",
      "pay him so that then he could use that money for you guys to go on fancy trips\n",
      "to Belize and Aruba and Napa Valley etc. And you would benefit yourself from\n",
      "that. If you just play out what that means, I mean, that's a lot to have to go\n",
      "through to take a couple of trips. Totally. And it has nothing to do with the\n",
      "guilt or innocence of the 19 people, four of whom have already pleaded guilty in\n",
      "the RICO election interference case that she brought. But if it were to be\n",
      "determined that she or Nathan Wade lied on the stand about when that\n",
      "relationship started, that would be very harmful to them as attorneys, you know,\n",
      "with their bar in Georgia and their future as attorneys and their ability to\n",
      "continue to practice. So, you know, it again has nothing to do with the criminal\n",
      "charges here and Bonnie Willis, I think, pretty rightly said, I'm not the one on\n",
      "trial here. It's the 19 people who were charged with crimes that are going to be\n",
      "on trial. Again, four of our depleted guilty. But there are things that, as you\n",
      "say, as a factual matter, could be significant. They just don't really have to\n",
      "do with guilt or innocence. Obviously, if the court were to find that there was\n",
      "this financial conflict, that she purposefully picked mixed or weighed in order\n",
      "to reap financial benefits, that might support disqualification. But that's\n",
      "where the judge right now seems to be thinking, I'm still not here. He said it a\n",
      "few times. That's what I'm focused on. Where's the financial conflict? Bring me\n",
      "that evidence and that's where it seems like they're lacking. So I think the\n",
      "thing now, they're going to argue about whether Mr. Bradley, this is Mr. Wade's\n",
      "former partner at his law firm, who became his divorce attorney, whether he\n",
      "actually can testify or whether that attorney-client privilege prevents him from\n",
      "testifying. And then after that, I guess Judge McAfee will issue a ruling so\n",
      "we're right now on hold I think. Yeah and just quickly the attorney-client\n",
      "privilege issue is a little complicated because this is a friend who was also\n",
      "Mr. Wade's divorce lawyer. So information he might have through Mr. Wade about\n",
      "who he was or was not sleeping with and when would be the kind of thing that a\n",
      "divorce lawyer would be interested in in terms of representing him and so that\n",
      "kind of information would be covered by the attorney-client privilege if it was\n",
      "said in the context of seeking legal advice and representing him. On the other\n",
      "hand, if Mr. Bradley was saying it because he observed Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade\n",
      "together in a way where he could draw a conclusion as to whether they were\n",
      "having a relationship that would not be attorney-client privilege. So this is an\n",
      "issue where a judge can cease things and hear things, you know, sort of off\n",
      "camera and then can make his decision. It's a little odd here because of course\n",
      "that judge is also going to be the decider of the facts. So he's going to be\n",
      "exposed to it, but presumably he then makes a decision about the evidence in the\n",
      "record that is admissible. So keep an eye out for what he does there, but I have\n",
      "trouble with the law here. I have trouble with the standard. I think it just\n",
      "seems so irrelevant to the criminal case. Yeah. And whether there are other\n",
      "consequences, I actually don't think the record's terribly good for the defense,\n",
      "even up for other consequences as of now. So, you know, I can understand why\n",
      "people are sort of like this as seems like a sideshow. Having said that, Mary,\n",
      "there's so much that we're going to keep our eye on. Absolutely. Because there\n",
      "really are, I can't really even say there are three balls in the air. There's\n",
